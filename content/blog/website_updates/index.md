I asked around for advice on everyone's thoughts on the website and started making some of the easier changes.
Thank you to everyone who took time out of their day to help me improve fernyfoods. Special thanks to
Karen, Naomi, and Danny.

I've always had a problem starting something; the search for perfection lingers in the back of my mind,
eating away at any thoughts. I think that what I've realized is that perfection is not some finished product
or idea, but rather a process. It is this idea of incremental change towards an idea that creates perfection.
Perfection in itself is something fleeting, moments away from fading away in your thoughts. However, by
working on it bit by bit, we can capture the essence of whatever blesses our minds in that moment of euphoria.

My goal with fernyfoods is to create something:
- clean
- minimalist
- informative
- engaging
- thoughtful

If I meet any of those goals, then I will be happy. Some ideas that I have for the website are to post recipes,
add restaurant reviews, and a map of all the places that I've eaten food. This is sort of a personal project for
me that I want to use to excercise my coding, writing, and expose others to the beauty of food and cooking.
